    <p>the silent oblivion haunted Pranjal ,the desolate nothingness, the crude darkness made it impossible for him to stay calm .’what in the world have I been into, just where am I’.. 

        The questions rang through his head when he suddenly heard faint but sure voices ringing far away. Whatever he could listen and understand just made up to a single conclusion ;he was trapped or as it could be said he was lost in a tunnel system and was unconscious until now. The sudden awareness sucked the breath out of his lungs, his voice- hoarse and pricly to the throat as he tried to scream for help. The footsteps that seemed to be nearing him suddenly started to fade away, sumit knew he had to do something. Something asap if he had to live to see the sun. Calming down as much as he can he took his helmet and found a piece of rock nearby. ( -.-.  ---  --  .)   (-…  .-  -.-.  -.-) (… ---  …){ come back sos} . Striking his helmet he proceeded  to produce morse code sos that they were taught as the most basic survival skills. Within a few minutes the rescue team decoded the message and worked their way towards him.  
        Sumit showed excellent presence of mind and used everything he had to survive despite being in a difficult situation.</p>
